## Overview
Menurithm processes operational data such as inventory levels and historical usage to generate recommendations that support planning decisions in restaurant and food service environments.

## Key Capabilities
- Inventory-aware menu planning
- Historical usage and demand trend analysis
- Decision-support dashboards for operators
- Integration with external supply coordination systems (e.g., Routecast)

## Architecture (High-Level)
The system follows a modular architecture with:
- Backend services that ingest and process operational data
- Structured relational data persistence
- Web-based user interfaces that present actionable insights

## Sample Interface
The screenshot above illustrates how planning insights are presented to users in a practical, operational format.

## Status
This repository contains an actively developed implementation of the Menurithm platform designed for real-world operational use and iterative refinement.
